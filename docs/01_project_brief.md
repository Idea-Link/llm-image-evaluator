# Project Brief: AI Prompt Evaluation Platform

### Executive Summary

This project introduces an evaluation platform designed to systematically measure the performance of generative AI prompts, with an initial focus on image generation. The primary problem it solves is the current difficulty in objectively quantifying the accuracy of LLM outputs. By allowing users to set a "ground truth" for a given prompt and compare it against the AI-generated results, the platform provides clear, data-driven insights. The initial target market is our internal agency teams, with the potential for future commercialization. The core value proposition is the ability to rapidly iterate and improve prompt quality through precise accuracy measurement.

### Problem Statement

The current process for evaluating generative AI prompts is manual, inefficient, and does not scale. Each prompt variation must be executed and reviewed sequentially, a significant bottleneck that prevents batch processing and aggregate accuracy analysis. This manual approach makes it extremely difficult to iterate on prompts effectively, as there is no streamlined way to run hundreds of tests, see a pass/fail percentage, and quickly inspect the specific results that were incorrect.

The direct impact of this limitation is a slower development cycle and a lower ceiling on the quality of AI-generated outputs. Without the ability to evaluate prompts at scale, our products and client deliverables are not reaching their full potential. While some evaluation tools exist, they are not tailored for the specific needs of image generation, which requires nuanced comparison against a visual ground truth.

Solving this is becoming increasingly urgent. As the agency takes on more client projects that depend on high-quality generative AI, the lack of a robust, scalable evaluation tool is a direct impediment to building "manufactured," top-tier solutions.

### Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is a dedicated platform for prompt evaluation. The core concept revolves around a structured workflow where a user sets up an evaluation by defining the criteria and "ground truth" for a desired output. The user then provides an input (e.g., an image) and a specific prompt to be tested. The platform will execute this prompt multiple times against a selected AI model, leveraging a system that supports prompt versioning to track iterations. The final output will be a clear accuracy score and a detailed report, allowing the user to quickly assess the prompt's performance.

This approach is designed for success because it directly replaces the current manual, one-by-one testing method with a scalable, data-driven process. By enabling evaluations at scale, it empowers our teams to rapidly iterate and definitively identify which prompts are most effective for which tasks.

The long-term vision for this platform is to expand beyond image prompts to become a comprehensive suite for all prompt engineering. Future capabilities may include support for text-based prompts, evaluation of tool calls, and API access for programmatic integration.

### Target Users

#### Primary User Segment: The Prompt Engineer

- **Profile**: The primary user is a "Prompt Engineer." This role is typically filled by a developer, a no-code developer, or another technically-minded team member who is tasked with creating and refining high-quality AI prompts. They are logical, methodical, and comfortable with an iterative, test-driven approach to their work.
    
- **Current Behaviors and Workflows**: Their current workflow is highly manual and inefficient. For each prompt variation, they must individually run it with a specific input, visually inspect the output, and repeat this process 5-10 times to gauge consistency. All results are then manually transcribed into a spreadsheet or table, where accuracy percentages are calculated by hand.
    
- **Specific Needs and Pain Points**: This user's primary pain point is the sheer tedium and lack of scalability in their current process. They need to break free from the slow, error-prone cycle of manual execution and data entry. They require a solution that automates test runs, aggregates results, and provides instant, quantitative feedback.
    
- **Goals**: The user's main goal is to achieve **observability** into prompt performance. They want to clearly see how changes to a prompt affect the outcome, which enables them to **iterate efficiently** and systematically **increase accuracy**. A secondary goal is to have visibility into the **cost** associated with testing different prompts and models.

### Goals & Success Metrics

#### Business Objectives

- To establish a new internal capability for validating AI prompts in bulk, enabling the evaluation of 100+ prompt variations in a single, automated run.
    
- To create a standardized, data-driven process for prompt engineering that improves the quality and consistency of AI-powered client solutions.
    

#### User Success Metrics

- The Prompt Engineer can successfully transition from a manual, one-by-one evaluation process to a bulk validation workflow, eliminating the need for spreadsheets.
    
- The user can clearly observe the performance of a prompt and its iterations, feeling confident in their ability to select the best-performing version for production use.
    

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Prompt Accuracy Score (%)**: The core metric displayed for every evaluation run.
    
- **Accuracy Improvement Over Time**: Tracking the percentage increase in accuracy score across different versions of a single prompt.
    
- **Number of Evaluations Run**: A measure of the platform's adoption and utility within the agency.
    
- **Cost Per Evaluation**: (Optional but desired) Tracking the token or processing cost for each bulk validation run.

### MVP Scope

#### Core Features (Must-Haves)

- **Evaluation Management**: Users can create new evaluations and view a list of all existing evaluations.
    
- **Evaluation Setup**: For each evaluation, the user can define a system prompt (which can contain text and/or images) and select the target AI model.
    
- **Categorical Ground Truth**: Users can define the success criteria for an evaluation by providing a list of acceptable text-based categories. The system must be able to parse the LLM's output (including from within a JSON object) to determine if it matches one of the predefined categories.
    
- **Batch Execution**: Users can trigger a batch run, which executes the prompt multiple times against the defined input.
    
- **Results Summary**: After a run, users can view a results page that displays an overall accuracy score and allows for inspection of the individual generated outputs.
    

#### Out of Scope for MVP

- More complex evaluators (e.g., numeric scores, direct JSON object validation).
    
- Dedicated workflows for purely text-based prompt evaluations.
    
- An external-facing API for programmatic access or integration with other tools.
    
- Advanced historical reporting, trend analysis, and performance dashboards.
    
- Multi-user accounts, team management features, and user permission levels.
    

#### MVP Success Criteria

The MVP will be considered a success when an internal Prompt Engineer can use the platform for a real client project to:

1. Run a bulk validation of a prompt.
    
2. Analyze the aggregated results and accuracy score.
    
3. Use this data to take meaningful, confident action (e.g., selecting the best prompt for production or identifying a clear direction for the next iteration).

### Post-MVP Vision

#### Phase 2 Features

Following a successful MVP, the next logical set of features to implement would include: Advanced Evaluators, Text Prompt Support, an External API, Collaboration Features, and Advanced Reporting.

#### Long-term Vision

The primary long-term vision is for this platform to become the central, indispensable suite for all prompt engineering and AI evaluation activities within the agency. Commercialization as a SaaS product remains a potential future opportunity.

#### Expansion Opportunities

A significant expansion opportunity is to evolve the platform into a generic evaluation engine for third-party AI services by adding the capability to evaluate "tool calls."
