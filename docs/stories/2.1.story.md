# Story 2.1: Test Set List Page

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** Prompt Engineer,
**I want** a dedicated page to view all my saved Test Sets,
**so that** I can easily access and manage my evaluation criteria.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A navigation link (e.g., "Test Sets") is added to the main application header/layout.
2. The "Test Sets" page displays a table or list of all existing Test Sets.
3. Each item in the list displays, at a minimum, the Test Set's Name and Description.
4. The page includes a prominent "Create New Test Set" button.
5. If no Test Sets exist, a clear message and a call-to-action to create one are displayed.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.4 completion:
- Header component exists at `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` and displays "Prompt Evaluation Platform" title
- AuthenticatedLayout is used for all authenticated pages
- Shadcn UI is fully configured with all components and theme variables
- Authentication middleware protects all routes except /login
- Testing pattern established using Vitest and React Testing Library

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
```typescript
export interface TestSet {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  json_extraction_key?: string;
  categories?: GroundTruthCategory[];
}

export interface GroundTruthCategory {
  id: string;
  test_set_id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
}
```

### Database Schema
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
- Table: `public.test_sets`
  - Columns: id (UUID), user_id (UUID), created_at (TIMESTAMPTZ), name (TEXT), description (TEXT), json_extraction_key (TEXT)
  - Has index on user_id for performance
- Table: `public.ground_truth_categories`
  - Columns: id (UUID), test_set_id (UUID), name (TEXT), description (TEXT)
  - Has foreign key relationship to test_sets table

### API Service Pattern
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#frontend-services-layer]
```typescript
// src/services/testSetService.ts
import { createClient } from '@/utils/supabase/client';

export async function getTestSets() {
  const supabase = createClient();
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('test_sets')
    .select('*');

  if (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching test sets:', error);
    return []; 
  }
  return data;
}
```

### State Management Pattern
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-architecture]
- Use Zustand for state management
- Create store at `src/stores/useTestSetStore.ts`
- Access state via hooks: `const testSets = useTestSetStore(state => state.testSets);`

### Component Architecture
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-architecture]
- UI Components: `src/components/ui/` - Reusable Shadcn components
- Feature Components: `src/components/features/test-sets/` - Test Set specific components
- Layout Components: `src/components/layout/` - Header component location

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Shared Types: `packages/shared/src/index.ts`
- Services: `apps/web/src/services/testSetService.ts`
- Stores: `apps/web/src/stores/useTestSetStore.ts`
- Page Route: `apps/web/src/app/test-sets/page.tsx`
- Feature Components: `apps/web/src/components/features/test-sets/`
- Header: `apps/web/src/components/layout/Header.tsx`

### Routing Architecture
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture]
- Use Next.js App Router
- Create new route at `src/app/test-sets/page.tsx`
- Route will be protected by existing middleware
- Use Link component for navigation

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Shared types MUST be in packages/shared directory
- Frontend MUST NOT call Supabase directly - use service layer
- All API functions MUST include try/catch blocks
- Component naming: PascalCase (TestSetList.tsx)
- Database table: snake_case (test_sets)

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Framework: Vitest with React Testing Library
- Test Location: Co-locate with components (e.g., TestSetList.test.tsx)
- Mock Supabase client in tests
- Test Pattern Example:
```typescript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { expect, test, vi } from 'vitest';

// Mock the Supabase client
const mockSupabaseClient = {
  from: vi.fn().mockReturnThis(),
  select: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({ data: [...], error: null }),
};
```

- [x] Validated comprehensive error handling in service and store layers
- [x] Reviewed responsive UI implementation with loading and error states
- [x] Verified test coverage for all components and service functions
- [x] Confirmed TypeScript compilation and ESLint compliance

### Security Review

**Status: Secure** 🔒

- No direct database access from frontend components
- Service layer properly abstracts all API calls
- No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data exposure
- Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- Proper typing prevents injection vulnerabilities

### Performance Considerations

**Status: Optimized** ⚡

- Zustand store provides efficient state management with selective subscriptions
- Components use conditional rendering to avoid unnecessary DOM operations
- Loading skeletons provide immediate visual feedback
- Proper ordering (created_at desc) for better UX with recent items first
- Minimal bundle impact with tree-shakeable imports

### Technical Excellence Notes

**Standout Implementation Details:**

1. **State Management**: Elegant Zustand implementation with proper async handling
2. **Error Handling**: Robust error boundaries in both service and store layers  
3. **UI/UX**: Thoughtful loading states and empty state messaging
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage with proper mocking strategies
5. **TypeScript**: Strong typing throughout with shared interface usage

### Final Status
