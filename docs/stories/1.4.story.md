# Story 1.4: Basic Application Layout

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** logged-in user,
**I want** to see a basic application layout with a header and a placeholder content area,
**so that** the application has a consistent and professional structure for all subsequent screens.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. After successfully logging in, the user is redirected to a main dashboard or home page.
2. The page displays a persistent header component.
3. The header displays the application's title (e.g., "Prompt Evaluation Platform").
4. The main content area below the header displays a simple "Welcome" message.
5. The Shadcn UI library is installed and initialized in the Next.js application, ready for use.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Update the existing header component to display the application title (AC: 2, 3)
  - [x] Modify src/components/layout/Header.tsx to include "Prompt Evaluation Platform" title
  - [x] Ensure header is visually prominent and professional using Shadcn UI components
  - [x] Verify header persists across all authenticated pages

- [x] Create or update the main dashboard/home page (AC: 1, 4)
  - [x] Update src/app/page.tsx to serve as the main dashboard
  - [x] Add a welcome message to the main content area
  - [x] Ensure the page uses the AuthenticatedLayout component
  - [x] Style the welcome message using Shadcn UI components

- [x] Verify Shadcn UI setup and configuration (AC: 5)
  - [x] Confirm components.json exists and is properly configured
  - [x] Verify Tailwind CSS integration is working
  - [x] Ensure all Shadcn UI dependencies are installed
  - [x] Test that Shadcn UI components render correctly

- [x] Update authentication flow to redirect to dashboard (AC: 1)
  - [x] Modify login success redirect in src/app/login/page.tsx to go to dashboard
  - [x] Verify middleware allows authenticated access to dashboard
  - [x] Test the complete flow from login to dashboard

- [x] Create unit tests for the updated layout
  - [x] Test header component renders with correct title
  - [x] Test dashboard page renders welcome message
  - [x] Test authenticated layout integration
  - [x] Mock authentication state for tests

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.3 completion:
- Header component already exists at `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`
- AuthenticatedLayout component exists at `src/components/layout/AuthenticatedLayout.tsx`
- Shadcn UI is already installed with components.json configured
- Logout functionality is implemented in the header
- Authentication middleware protects all routes except /login
- Login page redirects to "/" after successful authentication
- Zustand store manages authentication state

### UI Component Stack
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **UI Component Library**: Shadcn UI (Latest)
- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS ~3.4
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 15.4.6 with TypeScript ~5.5
- **Purpose**: Building blocks for the user interface with unstyled, accessible components

### Component Architecture
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-architecture]
- **UI Components Location**: `src/components/ui/` - Core reusable generic components
- **Feature Components**: `src/components/features/` - Feature-specific components
- **Layout Components**: `src/components/layout/` - Layout-related components like Header
- **Component Template**: Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- **Main App Page**: `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx`
- **Header Component**: `apps/web/src/components/layout/Header.tsx`
- **Authenticated Layout**: `apps/web/src/components/layout/AuthenticatedLayout.tsx`
- **UI Components**: `apps/web/src/components/ui/`
- **Login Page**: `apps/web/src/app/login/page.tsx`

### Routing Architecture
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture]
- **Framework**: Next.js App Router
- **Routes**: Defined by folders within `src/app/` directory
- **Protected Routes**: All routes except login are protected by middleware
- **Dashboard Route**: Main page at `src/app/page.tsx` serves as dashboard

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Component Naming**: PascalCase for components (Header.tsx)
- **Service Pattern**: Components must not call Supabase directly
- **Environment Variables**: Access through typed configuration object
- **Error Handling**: All functions must include try/catch blocks

### Application Title
[Source: Epic 1, Story 1.4 AC]
- **Title Text**: "Prompt Evaluation Platform"
- **Location**: Display in the header component
- **Persistence**: Should be visible on all authenticated pages

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Framework**: Vitest with React Testing Library
- **Test Location**: Co-locate tests with components (e.g., Header.test.tsx)
- **Mock Strategy**: Mock authentication state and Supabase client
- **Test Pattern**: Follow the established pattern from Story 1.3 tests
- **Coverage Areas**:
  - Header component rendering with title
  - Dashboard page welcome message
  - Layout integration
  - Navigation flow after login
