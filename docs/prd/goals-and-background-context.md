# 1. Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- To establish a new internal capability for validating AI prompts in bulk.
    
- To transition the Prompt Engineer's workflow from a manual, spreadsheet-based process to an automated, efficient platform.
    
- To systematically improve the quality, accuracy, and consistency of AI-powered solutions delivered to clients.
    
- To provide clear observability into prompt performance, including accuracy scores and associated costs.
    

## Background Context

The current process for prompt engineering is a manual, slow, and unscalable bottleneck. Each prompt variation must be tested individually, with results tracked manually, making rapid iteration and quality control extremely difficult. This platform aims to solve this by providing a dedicated, data-driven solution for running prompt evaluations at scale, enabling our teams to build higher-quality AI products more efficiently.
