# 3. User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The UX vision is to create a data-dense, utilitarian interface designed for maximum efficiency. The application should feel like a professional developer tool, prioritizing clarity, speed, and observability over decorative aesthetics. The primary goal is to enable a user to set up, run, and analyze evaluations with a minimum number of clicks and zero ambiguity.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

The core workflow will be built around a few key interaction patterns:

- A dashboard or list view for managing all evaluations.
    
- A comprehensive, multi-step form for creating and configuring a new evaluation.
    
- Clear feedback mechanisms for initiating and monitoring the status of long-running batch processes.
    
- A detailed, data-rich report view for analyzing the results of a completed evaluation.
    

## Core Screens and Views

From a product perspective, the MVP will require the following core screens:

- **Login Page**: A simple authentication screen for the admin user, with email and password fields (email can be pre-filled or hidden).
    
- **Dashboard**: A list view of all past and current evaluations, showing their status.
    
- **Test Set Management Page/Modal**: An interface to create, view, and manage reusable Test Sets.
    
- **Evaluation Setup Page**: A screen to create or edit an evaluation, which includes selecting a Test Set and defining the prompt/model to be tested.
    
- **Evaluation Results Page**: A detailed view of a completed evaluation's accuracy score and individual outputs.

## Accessibility

- **Accessibility: WCAG AA**: The application should adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards to ensure it is usable by people with disabilities.
    

## Branding

- No specific branding guidelines have been provided for the MVP. The initial UI should use a clean, professional, and minimal aesthetic, similar to other modern developer tools.
    

## Target Device and Platforms

- **Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive (Desktop-first)**: The primary target is a desktop web browser. The interface should be responsive but optimized for a desktop experience, as that is the expected environment for a Prompt Engineer.
