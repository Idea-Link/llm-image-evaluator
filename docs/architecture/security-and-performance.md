# 13. Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

Our security strategy relies on the robust, enterprise-grade features provided by our platforms (Vercel, Supabase, AWS).

- **Frontend Security**:
    
    - **XSS Prevention**: React's native JSX escaping will be used to prevent cross-site scripting attacks.
        
    - **Secure Storage**: Session tokens will be managed automatically by the `supabase-js` client library, using secure, `httpOnly` cookies.
        
- **Backend Security**:
    
    - **Input Validation**: All API inputs will be validated on the server-side within the Supabase Edge Function or AWS Lambda before being processed.
        
    - **Rate Limiting**: We will rely on Supabase's built-in DDoS protection. Function-specific rate limiting can be added if abuse is detected.
        
    - **CORS Policy**: The CORS policy for our Supabase functions will be configured to only allow requests from our production Vercel domain.
        
- **Authentication Security**:
    
    - **Session Management**: Handled entirely by Supabase Auth, which provides a secure, battle-tested system.
        
    - **Password Policy**: The single site-wide password for the MVP will be stored as a secure secret/environment variable, never in the code.
        

## Performance Optimization

Our performance strategy focuses on leveraging the highly optimized nature of our chosen stack.

- **Frontend Performance**:
    
    - **Bundle Size**: We will monitor bundle sizes using Vercel Analytics to ensure they remain small.
        
    - **Loading Strategy**: We will utilize the Next.js App Router's automatic code-splitting on a per-page basis.
        
    - **Caching Strategy**: We will rely on **Vercel's Edge CDN** to automatically cache static assets and pages globally, ensuring fast load times for users anywhere.
        
- **Backend Performance**:
    
    - **Response Time Target**: Synchronous API calls from Supabase Edge Functions should respond in **< 200ms**.
        
    - **Database Optimization**: We will use the **indexes** defined in our database schema to ensure all queries are highly performant.
        
    - **Caching Strategy**: For the MVP, we will rely on database performance and Vercel's frontend caching. A dedicated server-side cache (like Redis) is considered out of scope.
